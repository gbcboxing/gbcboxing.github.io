  <h3>Before the Fight</h3>
  <p>
    GBC belts were initially awarded at <a href="buff_lads_2019.html">Buff Lads 2019</a>, but <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> did not attend this event due to chicken pox. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> had been training hard for the event, performing shadow boxing, talking about boxing to his friend that apparently boxes, and even doing the odd push up here and there. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s inattendance was a huge shame, and everyone who attended was disappointed. However, the event had already been postponed due to <a href="quintin_steel.html">Quintin Steel</a>'s appendicitis, and it was too short notice to change the date again. Therefore, being the only GBC competitor at the time to both not have a belt and not have made a challenge, <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> became Number 1 Contender. He was then able to have his pick of belts to challenge for.
  </p>

  <h3>The Challenge</h3>
  <p>
    On Thursday August 15th 2019, <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> challenged <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> for the <a href="cruiserweight.html">Cruiserweight</a> title. He was thought to be at or below 61kg at the time, so he was eligible to make a challenge for the <a href="lightweight.html">Lightweight</a> title, however he chose not to. An excerpt from an interview dated 15th August 2019 is given below, detailing <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s thoughts at the time.
  </p>

  <b>Interviewer:</b> <i>Who would you challenge tho?</i><br>
  <b><a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>:</b> <i><a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> probs</i><br>
  <b>Interviewer:</b> <i>Yes, that makes sense. You could have the <a href="lightweight.html">Lightweight</a> belt off <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a> any time basically, but that isn't buff.</i><br>
  <b><a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>:</b> <i>Yeah, there's no bragging rights.</i>

  <p>
    <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a> responded to this on 22nd August 2019 with the following statement:
  </p>
  <b><a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a>:</b> <i>Doesn't matter if he could have it (The <a href="lightweight.html">Lightweight</a> Title) any time he wanted because I have it now and right now he doesn't have a belt to his name so I'm an undefeated champion and he's just him.</i>

  <p>
    <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s outlook at the time is thought to have been apprehensive. Sources close to him report him having spoken of his nerves, though official sources cannot corroborate this.

<h3>The Press Conference</h3>
<p>
  The press conference was held on 28th August 2019. The mood throughout the interview was tense, with both parties and their respective camps calling each other's credibility and trustworthiness into question.
</p>
<p>
  The press conference ended with a shocking display of violence. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> flicked <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s hair and <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> shouted "...he abused me!". <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s entourage rushed to his defence. The interview was called to an abrupt halt as chaos erupted throughout the building. Eventually security staff managed to separate the two boxers. Both were reprimanded by the GBC for their unprofessional behaviour.

      Some of <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s comments at the press conference caused a stir amongst the disabled GBC fans. In response to a question about his boxing history, he mentioned that he had "...two hands." One-handed and no-handed GBC fans everywhere were in uproar, and after recieving several complaints, the GBC tweeted:
