  <h3>Before the Fight</h3>
  <p>
    GBC belts were initially awarded at <a href="buff_lads_2019.html">Buff Lads 2019</a>, but <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> did not attend this event due to chicken pox. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> had been training hard for the event, performing shadow boxing, talking about boxing to his friend that apparently boxes, and even doing the odd push up here and there. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s inattendance was a huge shame, and everyone who attended was disappointed. However, the event had already been postponed due to <a href="quintin_steel.html">Quintin Steel</a>'s appendicitis, and it was too short notice to change the date again. Therefore, being the only GBC competitor at the time to both not have a belt and not have made a challenge, <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> became Number 1 Contender. He was then able to have his pick of belts to challenge for.
  </p>

  <h3>The Challenge</h3>
  <p>
    On Thursday August 15th 2019, <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> challenged <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> for the <a href="cruiserweight.html">Cruiserweight</a> title. He was thought to be at or below 61kg at the time, so he was eligible to make a challenge for the <a href="lightweight.html">Lightweight</a> title, however he chose not to. An excerpt from an interview dated 15th August 2019 is given below, detailing <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s thoughts at the time.
  </p>

  <b>Interviewer:</b> <i>Who would you challenge tho?</i><br>
  <b><a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>:</b> <i><a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> probs</i><br>
  <b>Interviewer:</b> <i>Yes, that makes sense. You could have the <a href="lightweight.html">Lightweight</a> belt off <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a> any time basically, but that isn't buff.</i><br>
  <b><a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>:</b> <i>Yeah, there's no bragging rights.</i>

  <p>
    <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a> responded to this on 22nd August 2019 with the following statement:
  </p>
  <b><a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a>:</b> <i>Doesn't matter if he could have it (The <a href="lightweight.html">Lightweight</a> Title) any time he wanted because I have it now and right now he doesn't have a belt to his name so I'm an undefeated champion and he's just him.</i>

  <p>
    <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s outlook at the time is thought to have been apprehensive. Sources close to him report him having spoken of his nerves, though official sources cannot corroborate this.
  </p>

<h3>The Press Conference</h3>
<p>
  The press conference was held on 28th August 2019. The mood throughout the interview was tense, with both parties and their respective camps calling each other's credibility and trustworthiness into question.
</p>
<p>
  The press conference ended with a shocking display of violence. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> flicked <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s hair and <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> shouted "...he abused me!". <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s entourage rushed to his defence. The interview was called to an abrupt halt as chaos erupted throughout the building. Eventually security staff managed to separate the two boxers. Both were reprimanded by the GBC for their unprofessional behaviour.

        There are many rumours circulating so I'm going to put them to rest. Firstly, I have no involvement in the Russian mafia now, or ever. As far as we know Sergei is just an average bricklayer. It is true that he offered me the chance to cheat but I didn't reply to him since I have no intention or need to cheat. There are also rumours that I support communism. This is not true. I respect people's right to support it but personally, I do not agree with it. Finally, whether you are disabled or not doesn't matter to me. I respect and appreciate everyone.
      </i>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  After reviewing the situation, the GBC decided that there was not enough evidence to continue the investigation. No links were found between Sergei Popov and the Russian Mafia, and Sergei claimed that his asking <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> to cheat was a prank by a friend, identified as "Ivan" who had taken Sergei's phone. The allegations of assault against a disabled man turned out to have been made up by <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s camp. The investigation was called to a halt, but not before serious damage had been done to <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s reputation in the boxing community.

  <h3><a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s Impersonation</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> was disappointed by the result of the investigation. He replied to a tweet from <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> discussing it, telling everyone that he still thought <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> was a "piece of shit" ..."(w)hether or not he assaulted a disabled man". The GBC replied, telling <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> that <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s political views were not under investigation, only reports of crime. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> took offence to the GBC's tone, and threatened to pull out of the fight. When the GBC told him that "You're the one making the challenge. You can walk away any time you like." <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> replied with a one word tweet: "#WickstockBoycott".
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> and <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> then proceeded to have an argument over twitter for several hours. During this time <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> challenged <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> to several fights but <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> declined, saying he wanted nothing to do with the GBC anymore. He then changed his handle from <a href="https://twitter.com/CandlewickGBC">@CandlewickGBC</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/Candlewick69">@Candlewick69</a>. As the argument progressed, several details came up that seemed to be inconsistent. <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> claimed that he had been investigating <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> for weeks with the help of <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s twin brother Chester, whereas <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> claimed he had Chester locked up so there was no way that was possible. <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> claimed also to have seen <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s tax returns, and that there was no way he was as rich as he said he was, a claim which <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> disputed. <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a>'s final claim was that he had seen the Russian flag raised over one of <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s mansions, and the bailiffs at another, and that <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s tweets' embedded location data told <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> that <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> was tweeting from a smaller backup mansion in Derbyshire. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> claimed that all of the GBC champions were fake, and their belts were unearned. The argument ended at nearly 4 am with <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> claiming the police were coming to arrest <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> for tax fraud. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> then blocked both the GBC's official twitter account and <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For two days GBC twitter was very quiet. The GBC posted a statement asking GBC fans to stay optimistic about their upcoming events such as the announcement they were about to make (The reveal of Buff Laddies). They also posted a request for anyone who had contact information for <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s twins Chester, Lester, or Sylvester to come forward, hoping to find a replacement for the fight, however nothing came of it. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> and <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> both tweeted voicing their disappointment with the situation, and the amount of effort that had been wasted.
  </p>
  <p>
    On September 16th, <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s real account tweeted the GBC saying that "...some impostor (has been) going around under my name." and asking "Why didn't you do better background checks?". After a short conversation, <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> revealed that he had been trapped in a cave in Saint Petersburg for over two months, explaining his absence at <a href="buff_lads_2019.html">Buff Lads 2019</a>. He had been rescued by Sergei Popov, who was there with his work to build an orphanage. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> explained his suspicions that his impersonator was in fact the Local Voice Changer, and he revealed his plan to replace the impostor at Wick, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. It was hoped that boxing at a high-profile match would force Fake <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> into the open, as people around him would question how he was in two places at once. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> hoped that "Everyone (would call) him out for going back on his (word)" and the embarrasment would force Fake <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> to show his face.
  </p>
  <p>
    With only 6 days to prepare for the fight, <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> showed real buff spirit in accepting the match. GBC fans around the globe were ecstatic that the much anticipated fight was back on. The stakes, already high, had just become even higher.
  </p>

<div class="card">

  <h3>The Fight</h3>
  <p>
    The fight took place on September 22nd 2019. <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> refereed and judged. The other two judges were <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a> and <a href="rock_kickass.html">Rock Kickass</a>. <a href="quintin_steel.html">Quintin Steel</a> was cameraman and <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a> was timekeeper.
  </p>
  <p>
    It had been raining on and off the day of the fight, and the ground was slippery and muddy. The grass was a bit unkempt and patchy. While the two boxers weighed in and prepared for the fight, there was speculation that they might have to fight in the rain. Thankfully, the rain stopped in time for the fight.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fight was filmed with a 3 camera setup, one camera on the judge's table, one on the roof overlooking the garden from the opposite direction, and one handheld camera operated by <a href="quintin_steel.html">Quintin Steel</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> entered the ring first from the stairs corner to his theme "The Candlebury Tales". He gave a throaty "ayyyyy" as he ascended. He was wearing a blue hoodless robe and his trademark pink gloves over his neck. Once in the ring, he showboated by lighting some money on fire and throwing it on the ground. He sang along with some of the lyrics from his theme song, then after putting on his gloves punched the camera <a href="quintin_steel.html">Quintin Steel</a> was holding, causing the filming to be interrupted.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> entered the ring second from the shed corner to his theme "Crushed". He was wearing a Welsh flag over his shoulders like a cape and had the GBC <a href="cruiserweight.html">Cruiserweight</a> Title belt thrown over his shoulder. Pyrotechnics shot flames upward on both sides as he came down the step toward the ring. As the music swelled, he threw his arms out dramatically to the sides. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> apporached <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s corner, and the two briefly touched chests in a show of aggression. The two returned to their corners and began to stare one another down.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a quick cleanup in the ring, <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> introduced the two fighters and told the audience "let's get ready to rumble". Without any further delay, <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a> began timing the first round. The bell rang. The fight everybody had been waiting for was underway. The world held its collective breath.

  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    The first round began with both fighters stepping up from their corners and meeting somewhat tentatively in the centre ofthe ring. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> threw the first jab, which missed, then <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> remembered to tell them to obey his commands at all time. The two touched gloves, and the fight began in earnest. <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> asked <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a> to give a short time extension on the round.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> once again threw the first jab. He jabbed again, and followed it up with a right cross which landed square on <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s cheek. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> retaliated with his own right cross, which landed. He thought about following it up with the left, but did not commit to the punch. The fighters had completed their first exchange, and neither had the upper hand so far. They broke away and circled each other in the ring, each trying to size the other up.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> threw a jab, which missed. As <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> stepped toward <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> with his guard down, <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> tried to punish him with a jab down the middle of <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s guard. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> blocked it. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> threw an overhand right, which <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> blocked. The two continued to circle one another.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> feinted, stepping forward as if to throw a jab. He followed it up with a jab-hook combination, trying to draw <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s guard down and catch him in the side of the head. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> ducked to his right, avoiding the punch. He tried to follow up with a cross to <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s face, but <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> blocked it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> stalked <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>, cutting off the ring and backing him against the high fence. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> bounced around, trying to position himself ready to intercept the next attempt. Eventually <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> stepped back, allowing <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> some breathing space.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> was the first to engage again with his signature meat and potatoes jab-cross. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> made the mistake of trying to block the jab with both hands, and was punished when <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s cross landed square in his mouth. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> retaliated with a jab, but <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> punched at the same time, and both punches flew harmlessly past one another. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> threw a right hook, but he was too close. His forearm landed across the side of <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s neck, and <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> caught it, leading to a clinch.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> split the two up, and they continued stalking each other around the ring. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> threw a feint, and <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> reacted by bringing both hands in front of his face. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> broke their stalemate, stepped forward with a right cross to the body, leaving his body fairly open. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> attempted to capitalise with a right hook to <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s face, but he did not commit to the punch. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> was able to knock it aside with his left and follow up with his own right hook. His hook missed, but he held onto <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s shoulder. He attempted to throw a left hook, but <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> caught it with his other arm. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> moved forward into a clinch, leaving his guard down. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> was able to capitalise with four light punches to the side of <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s head with his left hand.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> had come off a little worse in the exchanges so far, but was unfazed. He continued to circle <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>, staring him down. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> threw a jab from much too far away, measuring <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s reaction. Once again <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s hands came up into the middle of his body.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> approached <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> once again, this time leading with the right. His punch slid off <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s shoulder. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> was quick with the retort, throwing a right cross. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> stepped back, and the punch fell short. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> immediately followed up with an overhand left, which caught <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> square on the top of the head.
  </p>
  <p>
    The two continued circling the ring. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> clearly showed more energy, bouncing around on his toes, whilst <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> was slower and more deliberate. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> one again threw a jab from afar, which <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> stepped back from. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> threw another, and the same happened again.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> stepped forward to break the stalemate, but did not throw a punch, maybe hoping to keep <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> guessing. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> answered by leaning back and throwing a right cross, which landed. It wasn't enough to stop <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>, who responed by stepping forward into a southpaw stance and delivering an overhand right with the momentum of his body behind it. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> dramatically ducked to the right, dodging the punch but falling off balance. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> followed up, stepping forward into a right jab which connected with <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s body. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> kept the momentum going as <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> struggled to keep on his feet, throwing a straight left which hit <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s face as <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> was backed into a corner. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> followed it up with a left cross, which also connected. He tried an overhand left, but <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> stepped forward into a clinch.
  </p>
  <p>
    The two continued to circle each other, <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> seeming tired and <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> seeming rattled from <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s onslaught. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> returned to an orthodox stance and feinted twice more, first with his body and then with a jab. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s next jab sent <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s hands flying wildly to <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s right. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> siezed the opportunity, stepping through into a southpaw stance once again to deliver a right cross which despite <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s attempt to move his head back to dodge hit him in the face. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> followed through with his left foot and hit <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> across the face with a straight left. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> held on to <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s left hand with both of his, trying to force a clinch. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> attempted an overhand right, but <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> moved right and the punch missed. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> let go, allowing <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> to try an overhand left which also missed. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> was then able to force <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> into a partial clinch, forcibly pushing <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> back. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> tried to hit <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> twice in the side. The first blow landed clean, and the second was blocked by <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s elbow. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> pushed <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> out of the clinch, throwing another right hook which <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> blocked with his right hand across his body. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> threw again with the right, and again was blocked when both of <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s hands went up at arms length in front of his face. Now <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s back was against the wall. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> put up his left hand, trying to push <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s roadblock away. He swung again with the right, this time catching <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s forehead, though not very cleanly. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> threw a wild overhand right, which fell short. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> stepped back, and now <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> was on the aggressive. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> stepped forward while throwing a straight right, but <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> was able to move far enough back that it did not catch him. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> threw a right hook, but it also fell short, and <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> batted it away. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> lost his balance, falling forward and catching <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>, and the most savage exchange so far ended in a clinch.
  </p>
  <p>
    The two leaned on each other for over seven seconds. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> was heard at this time saying "Bugger". As <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> broke the clinch apart, <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> adjusted his mouth guard. The two circled slowly, <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> briefly outstretching his arms to the sides to taunt <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> was once again the first to step forward, but <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> answered with a jab from his right hand. It landed, but did not do any serious damage. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> followed up with an overhand left, which <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> blocked with both hands. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s body swung to the right as the two fighters' hands collided. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> threw an overhand right, but it slipped over <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>'s back. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> again pressed forward into a clinch, which eventually became more of a headlock.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="quintin_steel.html">Quintin Steel</a> has got very close to the two fighters at this time, and <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> briefly looked intimidatingly down the lens of the camera, walking around <a href="quintin_steel.html">Quintin Steel</a>. <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> told <a href="quintin_steel.html">Quintin Steel</a> to stay further away from the two fighters. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a>'s hands began to hand by his sides, and his circling began to look more like pacing. At that moment, the round ended and the one minute break began.
