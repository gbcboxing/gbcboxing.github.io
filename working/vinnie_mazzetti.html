  <h3>Challenge to the GBC</h3>
  <p>
    On June 20th, 2022 Vinnie Mazzetti appeared on twitter issuing a challenge to Bagstock and the entire GBC. He claimed to have "Beaten everybody I want to beat in New York", and was now coming to Wales to "Beat the shit out of some people here".
  </p>
  <p>
    Brick Buffpunch was hesitant to let a rank newcomer to the GBC have a title shot against the champion straight away, so instead he organised a fight versus GBC number 1 contender The Reaper, with the winner earning the No 1 spot. The fight was booked as Weekend at Vinnie's on the undercard of The Beard and the Bull.

  <h3>Financial Troubles</h3>
  <p>
    Vinnie was later found to have some serious financial difficulties. On 18th July 2022 he uploaded a video to YouTube where he was interrupted by his brother Larry Mazzetti. The two argued, and it emerged that their father had died and left the house to Larry in his will. Vinne was struggling to pay his share of the rent.
