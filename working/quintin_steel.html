  <h3>Buff Lads 2019</h3>
  <p>
    Buff Lads 2019 took place on Saturday August 3rd 2019, where the GBC belts were initially awarded. Challenges were made for the belts in descending order of weight. Jabadobbins went first and decided to challenge for the Heavyweight title. Bagstock went second and chose to challenge for the Cruiserweight title. The Reaper went third and challenged for the Lightweight title, then Quintin Steel went fourth and challenged for the Flyweight title. Rock Kickass declined to make a challenge. This meant that Quintin Steel became inaugural GBC flyweight champion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since there was no previous Buff Lads, the Most Improved Lad award was given to the competitior with the most buff spirit. Quintin Steel was awarded Most Improved Lad mostly for making a Red Bull logo in the car on the way to Buff Lads, and the Best Theme award for choosing a good theme song. Quintin Steel was the only competitor at Buff Lads 2019 to leave with two medals.
  </p>

  <h3>The Tin Man and the Dead Man</h3>
  <p>
    On the 5th of October 2019 Quintin Steel issued an official challenge for the unified lightweight and flyweight belts. The Reaper soon accepted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many attempts were made to schedule the fight, but ulitmately the covid-19 pandemic and the temporary closure of the GBC due to confrontations with the russian mafia meant the the fight did not see the light of day.
  </p>

  <h3>Accusations of Mafia Involvement</h3>
  <p>
    On the 3rd of June 2020, the independent news outlet GBC News tweeted that they had evidence to suggest that Quintin Steel's business, How Scrumptious Is That?, was a money laundering scheme. They also hinted that he may be involved with the russian mafia.
  </p>
  <p>
    On 5th July 2020 Quntin Steel released a video on twitter responding to these allegations in which he claimed the GBC was corrupt and that GBC News was simply clickbaiting.
  </p>

  <h3>Kidnap by the Russian Mafia</h3>
  <p>
    On 1st July 2020 the How Scrumptious is That twitter account posted a video with a message from Quintin Steel, who had been kidnapped by the russian mafia. He was being beaten and tortured. He was forced to read a message where the russian mafia demanded that the police release some arrested members of the russian mafia or Quintin Steel would be killed.
  </p>
  <p>
    It seemed that the russian mafia had control over How Scrumptious is That. Whether there were sleeper agents within the company the entire time remains an unsolved question.
  </p>

  <h3>Move up to Lightweight</h3>
  <p>
    On the 25th of April 2022, Brick Buffpunch announced via twitter that the flyweight belt was now vacant as Quintin Steel had weighed in over the acceptable limit for the belt and was moved up to the lightweight division. As the former flyweight champion, Quintin Steel was mandatory challenger for the vacant lightweight belt. Brick Buffpunch sent out an open invitation to anyone in the lightweight division to challenge him for it, with the deadline set for the 8th of May 2022.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the 8th of May with only 3 hours until the deadline, Cousin Clarence made the challenge. The fight was booked as The Beard and the Bull.
