  <h3>What is Chud Bungus?</h3>
  <p>
    The Chud Bungus method is a new approach for calculating 100m scores starting with Buff Lads 2023.
  </p>
  <h3>The Rationale</h3>
  <p>
    The previous scoring method was linear - you would score a point for each quarter of a second below the scoring threshold.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem with this approach is that it was unfair to speedy runners. Shaving a quarter of a second off your 12 second time should be worth more points than shaving a quarter of a second off your 25 second time.
  </p>
  <p>
    We want to reward buff running and incentivise the 100m as a viable path to being the buffest lad!
  </p>
  <h3>Does This Affect Buff Lads 2019/2022?</h3>
  <p>
    No, the scores from Buff Lads 2019 and 2022 are not going to be changed. This only affects scores from Buff Lads 2023 onwards.
  </p>

  <h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
  <p>
    The Chud Bungus equation is:
  </p>
  <p class="title">
    Score = 6860000 * Seconds ^ -4.13
  </p>
  <p>
    A handy calculator is on this page so that you can find your Chud Bungus score.
