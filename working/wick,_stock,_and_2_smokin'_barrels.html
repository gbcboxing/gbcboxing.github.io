  <h3>Before the Fight</h3>
  <p>
    GBC belts were initially awarded at Buff Lads 2019, but Candlewick did not attend this event due to chicken pox. Candlewick had been training hard for the event, performing shadow boxing, talking about boxing to his friend that apparently boxes, and even doing the odd push up here and there. Candlewick's inattendance was a huge shame, and everyone who attended was disappointed. However, the event had already been postponed due to Quintin Steel's appendicitis, and it was too short notice to change the date again. Therefore, being the only GBC competitor at the time to both not have a belt and not have made a challenge, Candlewick became Number 1 Contender. He was then able to have his pick of belts to challenge for.
  </p>

  <h3>The Challenge</h3>
  <p>
    On Thursday August 15th 2019, Candlewick challenged Bagstock for the Cruiserweight title. He was thought to be at or below 61kg at the time, so he was eligible to make a challenge for the Lightweight title, however he chose not to. An excerpt from an interview dated 15th August 2019 is given below, detailing Candlewick's thoughts at the time.
  </p>

  <b>Interviewer:</b> <i>Who would you challenge tho?</i><br>
  <b>Candlewick:</b> <i>Bagstock probs</i><br>
  <b>Interviewer:</b> <i>Yes, that makes sense. You could have the Lightweight belt off The Reaper any time basically, but that isn't buff.</i><br>
  <b>Candlewick:</b> <i>Yeah, there's no bragging rights.</i>

  <p>
    The Reaper responded to this on 22nd August 2019 with the following statement:
  </p>
  <b>The Reaper:</b> <i>Doesn't matter if he could have it (The Lightweight Title) any time he wanted because I have it now and right now he doesn't have a belt to his name so I'm an undefeated champion and he's just him.</i>

  <p>
    Bagstock's outlook at the time is thought to have been apprehensive. Sources close to him report him having spoken of his nerves, though official sources cannot corroborate this.

<h3>The Press Conference</h3>
<p>
  The press conference was held on 28th August 2019. The mood throughout the interview was tense, with both parties and their respective camps calling each other's credibility and trustworthiness into question.
</p>
<p>
  The press conference ended with a shocking display of violence. Candlewick flicked Bagstock's hair and Bagstock shouted "...he abused me!". Bagstock's entourage rushed to his defence. The interview was called to an abrupt halt as chaos erupted throughout the building. Eventually security staff managed to separate the two boxers. Both were reprimanded by the GBC for their unprofessional behaviour.

      Some of Bagstock's comments at the press conference caused a stir amongst the disabled GBC fans. In response to a question about his boxing history, he mentioned that he had "...two hands." One-handed and no-handed GBC fans everywhere were in uproar, and after recieving several complaints, the GBC tweeted:

        There are many rumours circulating so I'm going to put them to rest. Firstly, I have no involvement in the Russian mafia now, or ever. As far as we know Sergei is just an average bricklayer. It is true that he offered me the chance to cheat but I didn't reply to him since I have no intention or need to cheat. There are also rumours that I support communism. This is not true. I respect people's right to support it but personally, I do not agree with it. Finally, whether you are disabled or not doesn't matter to me. I respect and appreciate everyone.
      </i>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  After reviewing the situation, the GBC decided that there was not enough evidence to continue the investigation. No links were found between Sergei Popov and the Russian Mafia, and Sergei claimed that his asking Bagstock to cheat was a prank by a friend, identified as "Ivan" who had taken Sergei's phone. The allegations of assault against a disabled man turned out to have been made up by Candlewick's camp. The investigation was called to a halt, but not before serious damage had been done to Bagstock's reputation in the boxing community.

  <h3>Candlewick's Impersonation</h3>
  <p>
    Candlewick was disappointed by the result of the investigation. He replied to a tweet from Jabadobbins discussing it, telling everyone that he still thought Bagstock was a "piece of shit" ..."(w)hether or not he assaulted a disabled man". The GBC replied, telling Candlewick that Bagstock's political views were not under investigation, only reports of crime. Candlewick took offence to the GBC's tone, and threatened to pull out of the fight. When the GBC told him that "You're the one making the challenge. You can walk away any time you like." Candlewick replied with a one word tweet: "#WickstockBoycott".
  </p>
  <p>
    Candlewick and Jabadobbins then proceeded to have an argument over twitter for several hours. During this time Jabadobbins challenged Candlewick to several fights but Candlewick declined, saying he wanted nothing to do with the GBC anymore. He then changed his handle from @CandlewickGBC to @Candlewick69. As the argument progressed, several details came up that seemed to be inconsistent. Jabadobbins claimed that he had been investigating Candlewick for weeks with the help of Candlewick's twin brother Chester, whereas Candlewick claimed he had Chester locked up so there was no way that was possible. Jabadobbins claimed also to have seen Candlewick's tax returns, and that there was no way he was as rich as he said he was, a claim which Candlewick disputed. Jabadobbins's final claim was that he had seen the Russian flag raised over one of Candlewick's mansions, and the bailiffs at another, and that Candlewick's tweets' embedded location data told Jabadobbins that Candlewick was tweeting from a smaller backup mansion in Derbyshire. Candlewick claimed that all of the GBC champions were fake, and their belts were unearned. The argument ended at nearly 4 am with Jabadobbins claiming the police were coming to arrest Candlewick for tax fraud. Candlewick then blocked both the GBC's official twitter account and Jabadobbins.
  </p>
  <p>
    For two days GBC twitter was very quiet. The GBC posted a statement asking GBC fans to stay optimistic about their upcoming events such as the announcement they were about to make (The reveal of Buff Laddies). They also posted a request for anyone who had contact information for Candlewick's twins Chester, Lester, or Sylvester to come forward, hoping to find a replacement for the fight, however nothing came of it. Bagstock and Jabadobbins both tweeted voicing their disappointment with the situation, and the amount of effort that had been wasted.
  </p>
  <p>
    On September 16th, Candlewick's real account tweeted the GBC saying that "...some impostor (has been) going around under my name." and asking "Why didn't you do better background checks?". After a short conversation, Candlewick revealed that he had been trapped in a cave in Saint Petersburg for over two months, explaining his absence at Buff Lads 2019. He had been rescued by Sergei Popov, who was there with his work to build an orphanage. Candlewick explained his suspicions that his impersonator was in fact the Local Voice Changer, and he revealed his plan to replace the impostor at Wick, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. It was hoped that boxing at a high-profile match would force Fake Candlewick into the open, as people around him would question how he was in two places at once. Candlewick hoped that "Everyone (would call) him out for going back on his (word)" and the embarrasment would force Fake Candlewick to show his face.
  </p>
  <p>
    With only 6 days to prepare for the fight, Candlewick showed real buff spirit in accepting the match. GBC fans around the globe were ecstatic that the much anticipated fight was back on. The stakes, already high, had just become even higher.

  <h3>The Fight</h3>
  <p>
    The fight took place on September 22nd 2019. Jabadobbins refereed and judged. The other two judges were The Reaper and Rock Kickass. Quintin Steel was cameraman and The Reaper was timekeeper.
  </p>
  <p>
    It had been raining on and off the day of the fight, and the ground was slippery and muddy. The grass was a bit unkempt and patchy. While the two boxers weighed in and prepared for the fight, there was speculation that they might have to fight in the rain. Thankfully, the rain stopped in time for the fight.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fight was filmed with a 3 camera setup, one camera on the judge's table, one on the roof overlooking the garden from the opposite direction, and one handheld camera operated by Quintin Steel.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candlewick entered the ring first from the stairs corner to his theme "The Candlebury Tales". He gave a throaty "ayyyyy" as he ascended. He was wearing a blue hoodless robe and his trademark pink gloves over his neck. Once in the ring, he showboated by lighting some money on fire and throwing it on the ground. He sang along with some of the lyrics from his theme song, then after putting on his gloves punched the camera Quintin Steel was holding, causing the filming to be interrupted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bagstock entered the ring second from the shed corner to his theme "Crushed". He was wearing a Welsh flag over his shoulders like a cape and had the GBC Cruiserweight Title belt thrown over his shoulder. Pyrotechnics shot flames upward on both sides as he came down the step toward the ring. As the music swelled, he threw his arms out dramatically to the sides. Bagstock apporached Candlewick's corner, and the two briefly touched chests in a show of aggression. The two returned to their corners and began to stare one another down.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a quick cleanup in the ring, Jabadobbins introduced the two fighters and told the audience "let's get ready to rumble". Without any further delay, The Reaper began timing the first round. The bell rang. The fight everybody had been waiting for was underway. The world held its collective breath.
  </p>

    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>Round 1</h3>
  <p>
    The first round began with both fighters stepping up from their corners and meeting somewhat tentatively in the centre ofthe ring. Candlewick threw the first jab, which missed, then Jabadobbins remembered to tell them to obey his commands at all time. The two touched gloves, and the fight began in earnest. Jabadobbins asked The Reaper to give a short time extension on the round.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candlewick once again threw the first jab. He jabbed again, and followed it up with a right cross which landed square on Bagstock's cheek. Bagstock retaliated with his own right cross, which landed. He thought about following it up with the left, but did not commit to the punch. The fighters had completed their first exchange, and neither had the upper hand so far. They broke away and circled each other in the ring, each trying to size the other up.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candlewick threw a jab, which missed. As Candlewick stepped toward Bagstock with his guard down, Bagstock tried to punish him with a jab down the middle of Candlewick's guard. Candlewick blocked it. Bagstock threw an overhand right, which Candlewick blocked. The two continued to circle one another.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candlewick feinted, stepping forward as if to throw a jab. He followed it up with a jab-hook combination, trying to draw Bagstock's guard down and catch him in the side of the head. Bagstock ducked to his right, avoiding the punch. He tried to follow up with a cross to Candlewick's face, but Candlewick blocked it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candlewick stalked Bagstock, cutting off the ring and backing him against the high fence. Bagstock bounced around, trying to position himself ready to intercept the next attempt. Eventually Candlewick stepped back, allowing Bagstock some breathing space.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candlewick was the first to engage again with his signature meat and potatoes jab-cross. Bagstock made the mistake of trying to block the jab with both hands, and was punished when Candlewick's cross landed square in his mouth. Bagstock retaliated with a jab, but Candlewick punched at the same time, and both punches flew harmlessly past one another. Bagstock threw a right hook, but he was too close. His forearm landed across the side of Candlewick's neck, and Candlewick caught it, leading to a clinch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jabadobbins split the two up, and they continued stalking each other around the ring. Candlewick threw a feint, and Bagstock reacted by bringing both hands in front of his face. Candlewick broke their stalemate, stepped forward with a right cross to the body, leaving his body fairly open. Bagstock attempted to capitalise with a right hook to Candlewick's face, but he did not commit to the punch. Candlewick was able to knock it aside with his left and follow up with his own right hook. His hook missed, but he held onto Bagstock's shoulder. He attempted to throw a left hook, but Bagstock caught it with his other arm. Bagstock moved forward into a clinch, leaving his guard down. Candlewick was able to capitalise with four light punches to the side of Bagstock's head with his left hand.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bagstock had come off a little worse in the exchanges so far, but was unfazed. He continued to circle Candlewick, staring him down. Candlewick threw a jab from much too far away, measuring Bagstock's reaction. Once again Bagstock's hands came up into the middle of his body.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candlewick approached Bagstock once again, this time leading with the right. His punch slid off Bagstock's shoulder. Bagstock was quick with the retort, throwing a right cross. Candlewick stepped back, and the punch fell short. Bagstock immediately followed up with an overhand left, which caught Candlewick square on the top of the head.
  </p>
  <p>
    The two continued circling the ring. Bagstock clearly showed more energy, bouncing around on his toes, whilst Candlewick was slower and more deliberate. Candlewick one again threw a jab from afar, which Bagstock stepped back from. Candlewick threw another, and the same happened again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candlewick stepped forward to break the stalemate, but did not throw a punch, maybe hoping to keep Bagstock guessing. Bagstock answered by leaning back and throwing a right cross, which landed. It wasn't enough to stop Candlewick, who responed by stepping forward into a southpaw stance and delivering an overhand right with the momentum of his body behind it. Bagstock dramatically ducked to the right, dodging the punch but falling off balance. Candlewick followed up, stepping forward into a right jab which connected with Bagstock's body. Candlewick kept the momentum going as Bagstock struggled to keep on his feet, throwing a straight left which hit Bagstock's face as Bagstock was backed into a corner. Candlewick followed it up with a left cross, which also connected. He tried an overhand left, but Bagstock stepped forward into a clinch.
  </p>
  <p>
    The two continued to circle each other, Candlewick seeming tired and Bagstock seeming rattled from Candlewick's onslaught. Candlewick returned to an orthodox stance and feinted twice more, first with his body and then with a jab. Candlewick's next jab sent Bagstock's hands flying wildly to Bagstock's right. Candlewick siezed the opportunity, stepping through into a southpaw stance once again to deliver a right cross which despite Bagstock's attempt to move his head back to dodge hit him in the face. Candlewick followed through with his left foot and hit Bagstock across the face with a straight left. Bagstock held on to Candlewick's left hand with both of his, trying to force a clinch. Candlewick attempted an overhand right, but Bagstock moved right and the punch missed. Bagstock let go, allowing Candlewick to try an overhand left which also missed. Bagstock was then able to force Candlewick into a partial clinch, forcibly pushing Candlewick back. Bagstock tried to hit Candlewick twice in the side. The first blow landed clean, and the second was blocked by Candlewick's elbow. Bagstock pushed Candlewick out of the clinch, throwing another right hook which Candlewick blocked with his right hand across his body. Bagstock threw again with the right, and again was blocked when both of Candlewick's hands went up at arms length in front of his face. Now Candlewick's back was against the wall. Bagstock put up his left hand, trying to push Candlewick's roadblock away. He swung again with the right, this time catching Candlewick's forehead, though not very cleanly. Candlewick threw a wild overhand right, which fell short. Bagstock stepped back, and now Candlewick was on the aggressive. Candlewick stepped forward while throwing a straight right, but Bagstock was able to move far enough back that it did not catch him. Bagstock threw a right hook, but it also fell short, and Candlewick batted it away. Candlewick lost his balance, falling forward and catching Bagstock, and the most savage exchange so far ended in a clinch.
  </p>
  <p>
    The two leaned on each other for over seven seconds. Candlewick was heard at this time saying "Bugger". As Jabadobbins broke the clinch apart, Candlewick adjusted his mouth guard. The two circled slowly, Candlewick briefly outstretching his arms to the sides to taunt Bagstock.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candlewick was once again the first to step forward, but Bagstock answered with a jab from his right hand. It landed, but did not do any serious damage. Bagstock followed up with an overhand left, which Candlewick blocked with both hands. Bagstock's body swung to the right as the two fighters' hands collided. Candlewick threw an overhand right, but it slipped over Bagstock's back. Bagstock again pressed forward into a clinch, which eventually became more of a headlock.
  </p>
  <p>
    Quintin Steel has got very close to the two fighters at this time, and Candlewick briefly looked intimidatingly down the lens of the camera, walking around Quintin Steel. Jabadobbins told Quintin Steel to stay further away from the two fighters. Candlewick's hands began to hand by his sides, and his circling began to look more like pacing. At that moment, the round ended and the one minute break began.

  </p>
  <b>Quintin Steel:</b><i>So Bagstock, what did you think of that round?</i><br>
  <b>Bagstock:</b><i>I don't know. It was alright I guess.</i><br>

  <h3>The Judges Opinions After Round 1</h3>

      Round 2: Bagstock fires back with a flurry of punches that sends Candles's head into a fence! That's what you get when you're in the GBC!
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    Bagstock was first to answer the bell for the start of round 2. As they approached the middle of the ring and began to circle each other, Candlewick's hands kept dropping to his sides.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candlewick was the first to engage, feinting with the left, then stepping through with a wild overhand right. Bagstock sidestepped to the left but did not have time to return fire before Candlewick clinched.
  </p>
  <p>
    After Jabadobbins broke the clinch up, the two circled briefly before Candlewick threw a cautious jab. Bagstock answered with a right cross which Candlewick pushed aside. As he did so, Bagstock followed it up by stepping through into a left cross that went under Candlewick's arm and caught his chin. Bagstock kept the momentum going and threw an overhand right, which Candlewick blocked, his back slamming against the tall fence. Bagstock threw a left which connected with Candlewick's chest, and Candlewick threw a right that sailed past Bagstock's ear. The two clinched.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the clinch, Candlewick's foot slipped on the wet grass. The clinch lasted a long time with both fighters seeming to lean on each other. As Jabadobbins broke up the clinch, Bagstock aggressively pushed Candlewick away. Bagstock's hands snapped back up to a defensive position, but Candlewick's dangled by his sides.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candlewick continued to try to control the ring, despite his obvious fatigue. He adopted a higher stance and pressed on towards Bagstock. After a few seconds of pacing, he threw a bread and butter jab-cross combo, with the cross landing cleanly on Bagstock's temple. Baranby clinched. Candlewick threw a right hook, which Bagstock avoided by moving his head to the right. Candlewick threw another hook, but it overshot and turned into a grab. Candlewick got two light body shots in before they were asked to break the clinch.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the instruction to break, Candlewick inclined his chin at Bagstock as if to say he was unaffected, but his hands stayed down by his sides. He coughed, spitting out his gumshield. He was pushing it back in with his glove when Bagstock came in with an overhand right. Candlewick managed to knock it aside. Bagstock tried again, this time landing. At this blow, Candlewick made an audible grunt. Candlewick retaliated with a big overhand right, but Bagstock ducked it. They clinched, and Candlewick threw two illegal rabbit punches to the back of Bagstock's head. Luckily the damage to Bagstock's neck and spine was not serious. This rule break was missed by the referee at the time. Had it been caught, Candlewick would have had a point deducted in this round by all 3 judges. Bagstock threw two light punches at Candlewick's body, the first hitting his elbow, and the second too low to score. Jabadobbins stepped in again and broke up the clinch.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the clinch, Candlewick's hands went straight down again. Jabadobbins made a comment about how both fighters seemed tired. At that moment, Bagstock rushed towards Candlewick with an overhand left, which landed. Bagstock followed it up with a right hook, which also landed. Candlewick countered with a right hook. Bagstock caught it, but it stopped his attack. The two fighters clinched again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jabadobbins commeneted on the aggression from Bagstock. Quintin Steel made a sassy comment on the amount of grabbing that was going on. As Bagstock pushed Candlewick away to end the clinch, Candlewick loudly gasped. Candlewick circled slowly, then put his hand up to signal a time out.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candlewick's mouthguard was falling out. He made a small whimpering sound as he motioned for Bagstock not to attack. He said something which sounded like "please don't, no". Jabadobbins stepped forward and called for a time out. Candlewick's mouth guard fell on the floor as he tried to get it back in. Jabadobbins picked it up, but it was muddy. Jabadobbins rinsed it off and gave it back. As he was doing this, Candlewick leaned forward, panting. Jabadobbins asked Candlewick if he was okay. Candlewick replied that he was "just rattled, I'm good." Bagstock grew impatient, asking if Candlewick was ready to continue. Jabadobbins was not sure whether Candlewick had called for a timeout because just because of his mouthguard, or because he was too tired to continue. After briefly considering, Jabadobbins decided to tell The Reaper to give a short time extension on the round and not count it as a knockdown. He warned, however, that if it happened again, it would count as a knockdown.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bagstock circled briefly before throwing a jab-cross combo. Both were blocked, but Bagstock kept up the momentum and landed a jab. Candlewick stopped the momentum with two scrappy punches, immediately followed by a clinch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candlewick pushed out of the clinch almost immediately, then stood still with his arms by his sides, resting. Jabadobbins told the two that there was 30 seconds lef tof the round. Bagstock kept on going, throwing a jab-cross. The second blow landed with an audible thump. Again the two clinched.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bagstock seemed to smile as the clinch broke. He circled Candlewick, who walked in a small circle in the middle of the ring, conserving energy. Bagstock was again on the aggressive, throwing a jab-cross which Candlewick stopped by catching Bagstock with a nasty right cross. Candlewick went in for the clinch, but immediately regretted it when Bagstock caught him with a left hook that sent spit flying out of Candlewick's mouth. The two started almost grappling, trying to throw each other around. Candlewick landed a punch to Bagstock's body. Just then the bell rang to end the second round.

    Quintin Steel approached Candlewick, who was sitting in his corner.
  </p>
  <b>Candlewick:</b> <i>Fuck off!</i>
  <p>
    Quintin Steel walked to the other corner, where Bagstock was drinking water.
  </p>
  <b>Quintin Steel:</b> <i>How do you think that round went for you, Bagstock?</i><br>
  <b>Bagstock:</b> <i>I don't know. I'll wait until the end to comment. A little tired.</i>
  <p>
    Jabadobbins approached Candlewick's corner and asked him if he was okay. Candlewick said he was. Jabadobbins told him that if Candlewick was hurt, he should let him know. Candlewick replied laughing, and told Jabadobbins that this was the most exercise he had done in years. Candlewick's mouthguard again fell out, and Jabadobbins helped him put it back in, telling him to stop taking it out.
  </p>

  <h3>The Judges Opinions After Round 2</h3>
  <p>
    All 3 judges awarded the round 10-9 to Bagstock. Bagstock threw and landed more punches. Candlewick threw far fewer punches than in the first round, and landed a lower percentage also. Had the rabbit punches been spotted, this round could have been awarded 10-8 to Bagstock.

      Round 3: The dobber checks on Candles - perhaps he's fucked?
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>
    As the third round began, Jabadobbins commented that it was going to come down to fitness. Bagstock was again first to answer the bell. Candlewick was the first to attack, feinting with the left, then seeming to almost fall forward with a straight right. He connected with Bagstock's chin, and Bagstock went for the clinch. Candlewick didn't let him, and started grabbing and pushing like it was a wrestling match. Candlewick hit Bagstock four times with the right during the clinch, each landing cleanly. The last, however, was another rabbit punch. Again this went unnoticed by the judges. As the two pushed each other around, Bagstock landed three body shots. The fight was degenerating into a slugfest.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even though Bagstock had taken some serious punches just moments prior, he continued chugging on. Candlewick seemed more exhausted than ever, dropping his hands again. Bagstock again engaged, throwing an overhand right, which collided with Candlewick's punch in the air. Bagstock went low, but Candlewick was expecting it and caught him with a right hook, before throwing another rabbit punch. Bagstock stood up, throwing two uppercuts into Candlewick's ribs. The first landed, the second was blocked. Bagstock threw another which caught Candlewick in the chest. Bagstock threw two weird punches over Candlewick's shoulder, which landed. The two were told to break once again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bagstock threw himself at Candlewick again almost immediately, throwing with both hands. Not the best idea, as Candlewick's hands collided with his in the air. Candlewick threw an overhand right whilst holding Bagstock with his left, which Bagstock sidestepped. The clinch took the two to the lower fence. Candlewick's back slammed against it and he made a small noise as the wind was knocked out of him. Candlewick broke away and threw another overhand right which Bagstock slipped once again and punished with a straight right to the side of the jaw. Bagstock was not backing down in this round. He continued to press the advantage, throwing a right hook that went around Candlewick's hand and caught his face. Candlewick was visibly disoriented now, as he threw another overhand right which overshot and landed harmlessly on Bagstock's back. The two clinched, with Bagstock managing one more punch to Candlewick's face before they broke away.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candlewick stood bent over in the corner of the ring, sniffing and touching his mouth with his glove. Jabadobbins stepped in, asking if Candlewick was alright. Candlewick replied yes. Jabadobbins mentioned that he would not score this as a knockdown yet, giving Candlewick the benefit of the doubt. He had not asked for a break, he just looked exhausted and disoriented. Again Jabadobbins was in two minds about scoring it as a knockdown.
  </p>
  <p>
    As Jabadobbins finished saying that, Bagstock again engaged. He was not going to stop until the fight was over. He threw an overhand right which just barely landed as Candlewick's hands came up to block. Candlewick countered with a right cross, but Bagstock sidestepped it and retaliated with another right to the face. All Candlewick could do was clinch as his back met the tall fence again. Bagstock got another eight shots in at Candlewick's forehead and chest during the clinch, as Candlewick seemed not to be doing anything to stop them.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the clinch broke, Candlewick kept leaning on the fence for a few seconds. Jabadobbins decided to step in again, asking Candlewick to step into the middle of the ring. He wanted to check if Candlewick was dizzy or having trouble standing, as that would indicate concussion. He asked Candlewick if he was okay. Candlewick again replied yes. Jabadobbins asked if he was sure. "Yes came" the reply. Jabadobbins mentioned that Candlewick was not defending himself. "No, I'm not" Candlewick replied. Jabadobbins asked if Candlewick could continue, lightly pushing against his gloves to check if he was going limp. "Maybe, probably" Candlewick replied. This was not the response Jabadobbins wanted to hear. Jabadobbins asked him if he was sure 100%. Candlewick replied no. Finally, Jabadobbins asked if Candlewick wanted to continue. "We'll go until the end of the round" was the reply. Jabadobbins replied "okay, you can continue for now", scored it as a knockdown, and motioned for the fight to continue.
  </p>
  <p>
    gain Bagstock came in almost immideately, throwing a straight right, which landed. Again Candlewick clinched, and Bagstock landed two right hooks to Candlewick's ribs. Bagstock broke the clinch with a powerful right haymaker that Candlewick had to step back to avoid. It just barely skimmed Candlewick's head. Candlewick raised him hand to jab, but he was slow off the mark and Bagstock punished it with a one-two to Candlewick's forehead. Candlewick did not move his head away from the punches, he just seemed to soak them up. Candlewick threw a wild overhand right but Bagstock ducked it. Finally Candlewick managed to get the clinch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candlewick's reprieve was to be short-lived, as the command to break came almost immediately. Bagstock again came in with the right, but Candlewick blocked it. Candlewick replied with a right hook, but Bagstock ducked it and caught Candlewick lightly with a high right hook of his own. Candlewick threw a straight right which Bagstock dodged, but still got caught slightly at full extension. At this point, Candlewick's punches were like pillows and Bagstock was able to shrug them off. Again the two clinched.
  </p>
  <p>
    As The Reaper announced that there were 30 seconds left on the round, Candlewick leaned with his back against the low fence, panting. Bagstock approached him again and threw a right, which Candlewick blocked. Candlewick threw a right cross, which Bagstock dodged. The two clinched, and Bagstock got two body shots in, before going for the head. Candlewick stopped the punch to his head, and almost fell onto Bagstock, pushing him into the fence, leaning against him to rest.
  </p>
  <p>
    The call came to break and Candlewick went straight back to leaning against the fence. Bagstock stepped in and threw a straight punch at Candlewick's head, which was almost horizontal on the fence at this point. Bagstock was obviously holding back, not wanting to hurt Candlewick too much. Candlewick pushed Bagstock away with a low right cross which Bagstock avoided, but at that moment, Jabadobbins stepped in and ended the fight. He told all in attendance that Candlewick was no longer able to defend himself, that he was calling it off, and that Bagstock won by KO.
  </p>
  <p>
    When asked on the day, all 3 judges said that had the round gone the distance without the stoppage that ended the fight, they would have scored it 10-8 to Bagstock.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bagstock removed his gloves and threw them on the floor, shouting "in your face". Jabadobbins raised his hand up high, then he then fell dramatically back first onto the ground. Bagstock went to shake Candlewick's hand, but Candlewick told him to fuck off.

    Jabadobbins approached Bagstock and shook his hand.
  </p>
  <b>Jabadobbins:</b> <i>You've just retained the GBC Cruiserweight Championship. How do you feel? By KO in the third round.</i><br>
  <b>Bagstock:</b> <i>I feel good.</i><br>
  <b>Jabadobbins:</b> <i>Well, there we go.</i><br>
  <b>Bagstock:</b> <i>I'm sorry to my opponent. Sorry, but I've got the title. (Holding the belt overhead) This is mine. Thank you to all my supporters.</i>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, Jabadobbins was checking Candlewick for concussion, cuts, bruises, etc. Bagstock again approached Candlewick's corner, but this time Candlewick shook his hand.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jabadobbins continued to make sure Candlewick was okay. As he did so, Bagstock walked up and asked a question to the camera Quintin Steel was holding: "Who's next?"
  </p>

  <h3>The Aftermath</h3>
  <p>
    After the fight, Candlewick's once active twitter account stopped tweeting. Sources are unclear on this, but it may be because he did not want his friends to find out he was part of a stupid underground boxing championship.
