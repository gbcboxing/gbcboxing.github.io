  <p>
    Rock Kickass is the current GBC Flyweight champion.
  </p>
  <p>
    He has very good dental hygiene.
  </p>

  <h3>Buff Lads 2019</h3>
  <p>
    Buff Lads 2019 took place on Saturday August 3rd 2019, where the GBC belts were initially awarded. Challenges were made for the belts in descending order of weight. Jabadobbins went first and decided to challenge for the Heavyweight title. Bagstock went second and chose to challenge for the Cruiserweight title. The Reaper went third and challenged for the Lightweight title, then Quintin Steel went fourth and challenged for the Flyweight title. Rock Kickass declined to make a challenge. He bided his time, presumably with the intention of waiting until nobody was looking and then completely annihilating the absolute fuck out of someone out of nowhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rock Kickass was awarded the Rather Buff Deadlift award for his very buff deadlift.
  </p>

  <h3>Judging Career</h3>
  <p>
    Rock Kickass worked as a judge at both Wick, Stock, and 2 Smokin' Barrels and The Riser of the Dead.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the Riser of the Dead he scored the match 48-47 to Bagstock.
  </p>

  <h3>Flyweight Champion</h3>
  <p>
    On the 25th of April 2022 Brick Buffpunch announced that Quintin Steel had failed to make weight and was to be moved up to the Lightweight division, thus relinquishing his crown as champion which he had held since the title's creation. It was announced that with the lightweight and flyweight belts both vacant there were 2 weeks to make a challenge for each of them, and if nobody did they would go to the number 1 contender in their respective divisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cousin Clarence challenged for the lightweight belt, but as the sole competitor in the flyweight division, Rock Kickass was awarded the title.
  </p>
  <p>
    A truly deserved win, as all the competitors in the division had fled to other divisions rather than face him in battle. He was widely praised for achieving this momentous victory.
  </p>

  <h3>Buff Lads 2022</h3>
  <p>
    Rock Kickass competed in Buff Lads 2022. He had to go home early, so he buffly rushed his last few lifts. Despite this huge disadvantage his score was still very much improved from 2019. A true buff inspiration to us all.
