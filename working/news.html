  <h3>Early betting odds favour Quintin Steel!</h3>
  <p>
    <b>By Anthony Lizardgreen - 15/05/2022</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    A twitter poll posted by The Reaper earlier this week currently has Quintin Steel ahead with 75% of the vote!
  </p>
  <p>
	The twitter poll for The Riser of the Dead was split straight down the middle and that ended up as a draw - so if you want my opinion, I say trust the people!
  </p>
  <p>
	But in sport you never know until the night of the match! Stay tuned - the underdog may surprise us all!
  </p>
  <p>
	The poll still has 3 days left, so things may change - stay tuned for more GBC news updates!
