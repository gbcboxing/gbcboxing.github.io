<h3>The Beginnings of Buff Lads</h3>
<p>
  In July 2019, a buff challenge rang out across the world. That challenge was answered by six of the buffest lads in the world. Quintin Steel had appendicitis, so the challenge was postponed. Then all the lads except Candlewick got chicken pox, and all of them buffly recovered in time for the new date. However after that Candles got chicken pox and got absolutely shagged by it. Five buff lads stepped up to the bar to prove their buffness to the world.
</p>

<h3>The Weigh in and GBC Title Awards</h3>
<p>
  First, the five competitors entered to their theme songs and weighed in. Quintin Steel had made a Red Bull logo in the car on the way there, and it impressed the judges so much that he basically won Most Improved Lad on the spot. Challenges were made for the belts in descending order of weight. Jabadobbins went first and decided to challenge for the Heavyweight title. Bagstock went second and chose to challenge for the Cruiserweight title. The Reaper went third and challenged for the Lightweight title, then Quintin Steel went fourth and challenged for the Flyweight title. Rock Kickass declined to make a challenge. Since nobody challenged anybody, everyone who made a challenge was number one contender in their respective weight classes, and they all won by default. Thus the GBC had a new Heavyweight champion: Jabadobbins, a new Cruiserweight champion: Bagstock, a new Lightweight champion: The Reaper, and a new Flyweight champion: Quintin Steel. Candlewick's inattendance caused a huge upset, as the smart money before the event had been on Candles and Bing Bong fighting for either the Cruiserweight or Lightweight title at Buff Lads, but ultimately this was not to be.
</p>

<h3>The Events</h3>

<h4>Bench Press</h4>
<p>
  The first event contested was the bench press. Notable lifts include The Reaper who had achieved 40kg in training, but failed to reach it again.
</p>

<h4>Overhead Press</h4>
<p>
  Since there was no squat rack, the bar had to be cleaned into position before a lift was attempted. Notable lifts include Rock Kickass, who lifted the same weight overhead as in his bench press - proving his buff shoulders.
</p>

<h4>Squat</h4>
<p>
  Since there was no squat rack, the bar had to be lifted to shoulder height by the competitors not currently attempting the lift. Notable lifts include Jabadobbins, who when attempting 90kg fell forward and nearly died when the weight would have landed on his neck if not caught by The Reaper and Bagstock. Rock Kickass performed this lift with a kettle bell instead of a barbell.
</p>

<h4>Pull Up</h4>
<p>
  This lift was contested on the swings in the nearby park. The rules were arms at full lock to chin over the bar with any grip you like. Notable lifts include Jabadobbins only managing one because he had become fat, and Bagstock destroying the competition by beating the next best lifter by a margin of 300% with his 6 reps to joint second The Reaper and Quintin Steel's 2 reps.
</p>

<h4>100 Metres</h4>
<p>
  Next came the 100 metre sprint. This was contested in the park, with a run along three edges of the park starting at one corner and finishing at another. The corners proved very detrimental to competitors' total time, so that would be taken into consideration next time Buff Lads was contested. Notable runs include Bagstock destroying the competition with a time (17.09s) nearly 2 seconds faster than the next fastest (The Reaper with 18.94s). The scores were calculated by first rounding a runner's score up to the nearest multiple of 0.25 seconds, then a point was scored for each 0.25 seconds under 30 seconds. For example, Bagstock's run time of 17.09s was rounded up to 17.25s, then subtracted from 30s to give 12.75s. This number was then divided by 0.25s to give a total of 51 points. The 100 metres was performed in two flights, with the one not running timing the other.
</p>

<h4>Countdown</h4>
<p>
  Countdown was contested with 4 letters rounds, 2 numbers rounds, and 1 conundrum. Notable scores include The Reaper, the only person to score in a numbers round with his heroic 225 with a target of 226, and Jack, who got two 7 letter words, storage and variate (it didn't mean what he thought it meant, but it was still a word). In a normal game of countdown, only the contestant with the longest word scores, but at Buff Lads, all contestants with valid words recieved one point for each letter in their word. If a contestant spelled a word directly related to strength, such as "Lift" or "Strong", that contestant would score double points for that word. Unfortunately, no contestant managed to. If a contestant spelled a 9 letter word, that was also worth double points, though no contestant managed this either. If a contestant made a nine letter word about strength, such as "deadlifts" they would have scored 36 points for that word. In the numbers round, 5 points were awarded if a contestant made a number within a range of 10 to -10 from the target, or 10 points for the reaching the target exactly. All contestants to successfully guess the conundrum in 30 seconds would recieve 10 points.
</p>

<h4>Bicep Curl</h4>
<p>
  Next came the curl. This was performed standing with a barbell, from full elbow lock to touching the shoulders. If a contestant moved their back from a neutral position, the lift would not count. Notable lifts include Bagstock's very buff 35kg, and Jabadobbins's then PR 40kg.
</p>

<h4>Plank</h4>
<p>
  The plank contest was held in two flights, with the one not planking timing the other. Notable planks include Bagstock annihilating the competition with a plank 37 seconds longer (2:09s) than second place (Jabadobbins with 1:32s).
</p>

<h4>Clean & Jerk</h4>
<p>
  In this lift a weight was lifted from the ground to overhead in two movements, first onto the shoulders, and then overhead using the legs to drive the weight up. Quintin Steel and Rock Kickass did not score in this event because they could not lift the 20kg bar overhead and there was no suitable substitute.
</p>

<h4>Deadlift</h4>
<p>
  The final lift of the day was the deadlift. Notable lifts include Bagstock's heroic attempt at 110kg, Rock Kickass's heroic attempt at 30kg which led to his Rather Buff Deadlift award, and Jabadobbins taking literally one million years to lift 130kg and even when he did he just barely got the weight up and his form absolutely terrible and it's amazing he didn't injure himself.
</p>

<h3>The Award Ceremony</h3>
<p>
  There were no boxing matches at Buff Lads 2019, so after the events it was straight on to the awards ceremony. Jabadobbins won Buffest Lad with a score of 535. Bagstock won Pound for Pound Buffest Lad with a score of 7.533. Quintin Steel won Most Improved Lad with his buff spirit. Four more awards were also distributed: The Rather Buff Deadlift award was given to Rock Kickass for his attempts at 30kg, the Scored in Maths award was given to The Reaper for scoring any points in the maths rounds of countdown, the Best Theme award was given to Quintin Steel, and the Got Ill 3 Days Before Buff Lads award was given to Candlewick in absence. The contenders listened to Don't Cry For Me Argentina and hung their heads in collective sadness.
</p>
<p>
  The Got Ill 3 Days Before Buff Lads award was given to Quintin Steel to take back to Candles, but it never got to him. Candles only discovered that he had won an award 2.5 years later, when we discovered that Quintin Steel must have not given a shit and probably threw it out of the car window.
