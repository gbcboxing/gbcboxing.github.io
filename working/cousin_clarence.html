  <p>
    Cousin Clarence is a competitor in the GBC who fights in the Lightweight division.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cousin Clarence is <b>ABSOLUTELY NOT A FEMALE</b> because in the GBC there are <b>NO GIRLS ALLOWED</b>. Cousin Clarence is a man, which you can tell by his beard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clarence is a rather mysterious competitor in the GBC, having only ever tweeted once. From what we can tell he lives a life of buff manliness in the wilderness somewhere, maybe alaska or something like that. Wherever it is he probably doesn't have internet access.
  </p>

  <h3>Buff Lads 2022</h3>
  <p>
    Cousin Clarence was a surprise entrant to Buff Lads 2022. He turned up and just started being buff with no warning. This has widely been considered a chad move.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clarence's debut performance at Buff Lads earned him the silver medal in the plank, and the bronze medal in the deadlift. Some rather buff scores indeed.
  </p>

  <h3>The Beard and the Bull</h3>
  <p>
    On May 8th, Clarence issued a challenge for the vacant GBC lightweight belt. This fight was booked as The Beard and the Bull.
