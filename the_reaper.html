  <p>
    The Reaper (also known as El Segador) is the inagural and former GBC <a href="lightweight.html">Lightweight</a> champion.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Reaper is very edgy and has silly hair.
  </p>
  <p>
    He is also the only member of the GBC to have scored a point during the maths section of Countdown during <a href="buff_lads_2019.html">Buff Lads 2019</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Reaper has the second best fight record in the entire GBC, at 0-0-1. 
  </p>

  <h3><a href="buff_lads_2019.html">Buff Lads 2019</a></h3>
  <p>
    <a href="buff_lads_2019.html">Buff Lads 2019</a> took place on Saturday August 3rd 2019, where the GBC belts were initially awarded. Challenges were made for the belts in descending order of weight. <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> went first and decided to challenge for the <a href="heavyweight.html">Heavyweight</a> title. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> went second and chose to challenge for the <a href="cruiserweight.html">Cruiserweight</a> title. The Reaper went third and challenged for the <a href="lightweight.html">Lightweight</a> title, then <a href="quintin_steel.html">Quintin Steel</a> went fourth and challenged for the <a href="flyweight.html">Flyweight</a> title. <a href="rock_kickass.html">Rock Kickass</a> declined to make a challenge. This meant that The Reaper became inaugural GBC <a href="lightweight.html">Lightweight</a> champion.

  </p>
  <p>
    The Reaper's pound for pound score at this event was 6.66, which was probably intentional. He most likely sandbagged just to have a satan number because he is edgy. 
  </p>

  <h3>The Tin Man and the Dead Man</h3>
  <p>
    On the 5th of October 2019 <a href="quintin_steel.html">Quintin Steel</a> issued an official challenge for the unified <a href="lightweight.html">Lightweight</a> and <a href="flyweight.html">Flyweight</a> belts. The Reaper soon accepted. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Many attempts were made to schedule the fight, but ulitmately the covid-19 pandemic and the temporary closure of the GBC due to confrontations with the russian mafia meant the the fight did not see the light of day.
  </p>

  <h3>Move up to <a href="cruiserweight.html">Cruiserweight</a></h3>
  <p>
    On the 20th of February 2022 The Reaper announced on twitter that he had weighed in during training at 64kg and was voluntarily giving up the <a href="lightweight.html">Lightweight</a> belt in order to move up to <a href="cruiserweight.html">Cruiserweight</a>. At this time sources close to The Reaper say that he felt he had achieved all he could in the division and now it was time to move on to a new challenge. 
  </p>
  <p>
    After <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> was stripped of the <a href="heavyweight.html">Heavyweight</a> title as he was presumed dead, The Reaper and <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> became the two top contenders in the GBC. Brick Buffpunch began organising a fight between them. 
  </p>
  <p>
    However, it turned out that <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> was in fact alive. Brick Buffpunch then organised a twitter poll to ask the GBC fans who they wanted to see fight for the <a href="heavyweight.html">Heavyweight</a> title, promising to book whichever fight won the poll. Among these were <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> vs The Reaper, The Reaper vs <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>, and <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> vs <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a>. 
  </p>

  <h3><a href="the_riser_of_the_dead.html">The Riser Of The Dead</a></h3>
  <p>
    After <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> was presumed killed by the russian mafia, the <a href="heavyweight.html">Heavyweight</a> belt he had previously held became vacant. The top two contenders in the GBC were <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> and The Reaper, so Brick Buffpunch began organising a fight between them to decide the new <a href="heavyweight.html">Heavyweight</a> champion. However, when <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> returned, Brick Buffpunch was forced to consider him a contender. Thus Brick Buffpunch organised a twitter poll in which all fans of the GBC were asked to vote on the fight they most wanted to see: <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> vs The Reaper, The Reaper vs <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>, or <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> vs <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The poll was very close, but was eventually won by The Reaper vs <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>. This fight was booked as <a href="the_riser_of_the_dead.html">The Riser Of The Dead</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fight took place on the 15th of April 2022, with a sold-out Tondu garden arena in attendance. Spectators even took spots in the nearby park and illegally filmed the fight.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fight was extremely close and ended up being ruled a split decision draw. With no valid claimant yet to the <a href="heavyweight.html">Heavyweight</a> belt, it remained vacant. The Reaper was disappointed by this result, as nobody wanted to see an indecisive end to the match. He returned to training, determined to win the inevitable rematch. 
  </p>

  <h3><a href="buff_lads_2022.html">Buff Lads 2022</a></h3>
  <p>
    The long-awaited return of Buff Lads came on the 5th of June 2022. The Reaper attended and showed true buffness.
  </p>
  <p>
    During Buff Lads, The Reaper was unexpectedly taken to a police interview. There was some concern over whether he would be returning to finish Buff Lads or whether he would be arrested and thrown in the slammer. However he returned and completed his buff events for the day.
  </p>
  <p>
    He claimed the gold medals in the 100 metres and plank, silver in pull ups and bicep curl, and bronze in bench press, clean & jerk, countdown, overhead press, and squat.
  </p>
  <p>
    He claimed the silver medal in Lb for Lb buffest lad.
