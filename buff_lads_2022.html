<h3>Brick Buffpunch and the GBC Takeover</h3>
<p>
  In January 2022 the GBC came back from a long time of radio silence. It turned out that after the russian mafia attacks of 2022 the GBC had spiralled into an all out war with the russian mafia. Eventually they seiged the GBC's office in Wales, forcing the remaining staff members to escape at night. During this escape, <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> was shot by a russian mafia sniper and believed to be dead.
</p>
<p>
  Brick Buffpunch assumed control of the company and led the remaining staff members to Fiji, where he established a new office. Once they got set up, Brick Buffpunch announced Buff Lads 2022.
</p>

<h3>The Buff Lads Arrive</h3>
<p>
  <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> and <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> were already at the venue, having buffly been training in advance of the event. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> had missed the previous one and determined not
</p>
<p>
  The other lads arrived in the Buff Bus and sprung out ready to lift with the power of the gods. They were greeted by a sign emblazoned with BUFF LADS 2022. This emboldened their buff spirits from "quite buff" to "very buff". <a href="quintin_steel.html">Quintin Steel</a> had brought his Red Bull Sword, a powerful blade with the ability to slice through the very fabric of weakness itself.
</p>
<p>
  The lads were soon joined by a surprise participant - a bearded gentleman had arrived from the deepest reaches of the wilderness. <a href="cousin_clarence.html">Cousin Clarence</a> had pulled up, ready to join the buffness.
</p>
<p>
  At the beginning of the competition, <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> announced a surprise additional challenge - the hat contest. Hats were given out to each competitor, and an additional prize would go to whichever lad could keep their hat on for the longest.
</p>

<h3>The Events</h3>

<h4>Bench Press</h4>
<p>
  The bench press was the first event contested.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> and <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> were rivals in this event. First they both bench pressed 80kg. Then they both tried 85kg and both failed. Then they put on the earrings - 2 small 1kg weights attached to strings - to make the bar weigh 82kg. On this lift, <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> failed and <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> succeeded, making him the official champion.
</p>

<h4>Bicep Curl</h4>
<p>
  <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> immediately struck back, ANNIHILATING the competition with an almighty bicep curl of 55kg.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> was proud of his performance at this event, where he got a lovely joint silver medal to take home, thus cucking <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a>.
</p>

<h4>Pull Ups</h4>
<p>
  The lads had much improved on their prior pull up buffness, and entered this event ready to show themselves 3 years ago who was boss.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> delivered in fine form, doubling his previous record with a highly buff 12 pull ups.
</p>

<h4>100 Meters</h4>
<p>
  This year the 100 metres was contested in the nearby street, Iron Way, chosen for its buff name. The street had been measured on google maps and was found to be almost exactly 100 metres from one kerb to a line on the road. This was an improvement over the last year since it was a straight flat track.
</p>
<p>
  After waiting for a few vans, the lads ran the run in 2 flights. Each person chose someone to time them on their run.
</p>
<p>
  The event was won by <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a>, who probably learned to run that fast by running from angry fathers while rape alarms blared in the background.
</p>

<h4>Countdown</h4>
<p>
  The countdown round again saw nobody get a strength word, however the average scores were much higher than 2019. All the lads had been watching channel 4 every night in preparation for this fateful day.
</p>

<h4>Overhead Press</h4>
<p>
  For this the squat rack was brought outside onto the patio.
</p>
<p>
  Part way through this event, <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a> unexpectedly announced that he had to leave and go to a police interview on suspicion of rape (not pogchamp). He left in police custody as helicopters and searchlights circled the garden. A swat team kicked in the door and threw flashbang grenades which temporarily blinded <a href="rock_kickass.html">Rock Kickass</a>. The competition continued without him, as the other lads wondered whether he would ever return, or spend the rest of his life in the slammer.
</p>
<p>
  Most gutting of all, <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a> was asked by the police to remove his hat so they could search it for photos of his victims.
</p>

<h4>Squat</h4>
<p>
  This event saw <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> crush the competition with an almighty 105kg. However his joy was to be short-lived as his hat had disintegrated in the rain and fell off as it caught on the bar.
</p>

<h4>Deadlift</h4>
<p>
  <a href="cousin_clarence.html">Cousin Clarence</a> surprised the competition on the deadlift, reaching the podium with a buff 85kg. This may possibly be because he spends all his time picking up bison he has killed with his bare hands in the wilderness, as well as poor hikers who have strayed too far from the path.
</p>
<p>
  This event again saw the rivalry of <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> and <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> as both buffly lifted all the way up to 140kg. However, to make this lift <a href="jabadobbins.html">Jabadobbins</a> had to take off his shoes, jumper, and glasses to cut weight. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> attempted 142kg, but was unable to lift the weight of the earrings. Therefore this round was a draw.
</p>
<p>
  By this time, only 2 lads still had their hats on - <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> and <a href="rock_kickass.html">Rock Kickass</a>. While <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> had been running in the 100 metres, his had had become precariously loose. Finally the cardboard gave way and <a href="rock_kickass.html">Rock Kickass</a> was the winner of the 2023 hat prize.
</p>

<h4>Clean & Jerk</h4>
<p>
  Nothing happened at this event.
</p>

<h4>Plank</h4>
<p>
  After the lads had finished all the other lifts, <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a> returned from his court trial. Found not guilty (for now) he returned just in time to catch up on the lifts. Upon his return, <a href="rock_kickass.html">Rock Kickass</a> left, as he does not associate with molesters. Had he stayed, asses would have been kicked. Let me tell you, <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a> is lucky he did not stay.
</p>
<p>
  After he had caught up, the planks began. <a href="candlewick.html">Candlewick</a> serenaded everyone with his golden voice, singing banger after banger. 
</p>
<p>
  The event was won by <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a>. Prison really changes a man.
