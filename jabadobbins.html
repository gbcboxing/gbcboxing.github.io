  <p>
    Jabadobbins is the former <a href="heavyweight.html">Heavyweight</a> champion of the GBC and the founder and former CEO of the GBC.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jabadobbins is quite fat. He often claims to be bulking when in fact he eats like a pig and barely exercises. He tries to portray himself as a legitimate athlete but largely sucks.
  </p>

  <h3>Founding the GBC</h3>
  <p>
    Jabadobbins founded the GBC in 2019 when he discovered he had a garden which he could use to commit acts of extreme violence on children.
  </p>
  <p>
    Immediately after creating the company he awarded himself with the best belt and claimed he was the legitimate <a href="heavyweight.html">Heavyweight</a> champion of the world without fighting anyone for it.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="buff_lads_2019.html">Buff Lads 2019</a></h3>
  <p>
    <a href="buff_lads_2019.html">Buff Lads 2019</a> took place on Saturday August 3rd 2019, where the GBC belts were initially awarded. Challenges were made for the belts in descending order of weight. Jabadobbins went first and decided to challenge for the <a href="heavyweight.html">Heavyweight</a> title. <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> went second and chose to challenge for the <a href="cruiserweight.html">Cruiserweight</a> title. <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a> went third and challenged for the <a href="lightweight.html">Lightweight</a> title, then <a href="quintin_steel.html">Quintin Steel</a> went fourth and challenged for the <a href="flyweight.html">Flyweight</a> title. <a href="rock_kickass.html">Rock Kickass</a> declined to make a challenge. This meant that Jabadobbins became inaugural GBC <a href="heavyweight.html">Heavyweight</a> champion by default. He has been quoted as saying it "still counts".
  </p>
  <p>
    Jabadobbins achieved the highest scores in the bench press, squat, deadlift, overhead press, clean and jerk, and the bicep curl, and tied for first in countdown. He was Buffest Lad, with a total score of 535 points.
  </p>

  <h3>Russian Mafia Problems</h3>
  <p>
    Under Jabadobbins's leadership, the GBC was plagued by the russian mafia. At first it was only corruption and bribery, but before long they escalated to full scale assassination and kidnapping. Eventually the offices of the GBC were beseiged and nobody was allowed in or out for several months.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jabadobbins and Brick Buffpunch led an escape team out of the beseiged building to a nearby boat, but on the way there Jabadobbins was shot in the shoulder by a russian mafia sniper. Brick Buffpunch left him for dead and escaped in the boat.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jabadobbins in fact survived being shot and went to hospital, where he spent the next several months recovering. When he left hospital he found that Brick Buffpunch had taken over as CEO and moved the offices of the GBC to Fiji to get away from the russian mafia.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, when Jabadobbins approached Brick Buffpunch to return to his role of leadership in the GBC, it seemed that Brick was not in a rush to step down. Jabadobbins found his belt stripped from him as he was presumed dead, and Brick Buffpunch was already organising a match between <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a> and <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> for the vacant <a href="heavyweight.html">Heavyweight</a> belt.
  </p>

  <h3>Return to the GBC</h3>
  <p>
    Eventually Brick Buffpunch organised a twitter poll to decide who would be fighting for the <a href="heavyweight.html">Heavyweight</a> championship. Possible fights were Jabadobbins vs <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a>, <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a> vs <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>, and <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a> vs Jabadobbins. This poll was won by <a href="the_reaper.html">The Reaper</a> vs <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>, and ultimately the fight was booked as <a href="the_riser_of_the_dead.html">The Riser Of The Dead</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jabadobbins was incredibly cross about this and launched an angry twitter tirade at Brick Buffpunch, accusing him of all sorts of made up nonsense which definitely ain't true. This led to Jabadobbins boycotting the event and refusing to show up and show support for his fellow GBC competitors. What a terrible sport.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="buff_lads_2022.html">Buff Lads 2022</a></h3>
  <p>
    Jabadobbins came to <a href="buff_lads_2022.html">Buff Lads 2022</a> to attempt to defend his Buffest Lad title. He was unsuccessful, and not only lost the title to <a href="bagstock.html">Bagstock</a>, but came 4th in Lb for Lb buffest lad. This is what zero pussy does to a mf.
